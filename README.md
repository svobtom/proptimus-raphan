# PROPTIMUS RAPHAN

## Description

PROPTIMUS RAPHAN is a rapid alternative to optimisation with constrained alpha carbons. This approach divides a protein structure into overlapping substructures, allowing each to be optimised independently. As a result, the computation time is linear with respect to the size of the structure. Our approach can achieve results comparable to the overall optimisation of the structure with constrained alpha carbons in significantly less time. PROPTIMUS RAPHAN employs an almost quantum-mechanical-accurate force field, [GFN-FF](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.202004239). This force field is generic, physics-based, and suitable for large molecular systems. The details about the methodology are described in the [wiki](https://github.com/sb-ncbr/proptimus_raphan/wiki).

## Getting Started

**1. Download and run the [Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main) installer**

```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

**2. Set up Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

* Create a virtual environment named `proptimus_raphan_env`:

```
conda create -n proptimus_raphan_env python=3.12
```

* Activate the virtual environment:

```
conda activate proptimus_raphan_env
```

**3. Install Required Packages**

* Make sure your virtual environment is activated, then run:

```
conda install -c conda-forge libgfortran=3.0.0 xtb=6.6.1 biopython=1.85 rdkit=2025.09.1 tqdm=4.67.1
```

**4. Clone this github repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/sb-ncbr/proptimus_raphan
```


## Executing the calculation

### Required arguments

`--PDB_file PDB_FILE `          PDB file with structure, which should be optimised.

`--data_dir DATA_DIR `          Directory for saving results.

### Optional arguments

`--cpu CPU`                                       How many CPUs should be used for the calculation.

`--delete_auxiliary_files`                        Auxiliary calculation files can be large. With this argument, the auxiliary files will be deleted during the calculation. Do not use in combination with the argument --constrained_alpha_carbons_optimisations!

`--constrained_alpha_carbons_optimisations`       For testing the methodology. The original structure and the PROPTIMUS RAPHAN optimized structure will be optimized with constrained alpha carbons. Short comparison will be stored in <data_dir>/comparison.json. Please note that optimization with constrained alpha carbons is computationally expensive for larger protein structures.

### Example of executing the calculation:

```bash
$  conda activate proptimus_raphan_env
$  cd proptimus_raphan
$  python raphan.py --PDB_file examples/P0DL07.pdb --data_dir P0DL07_test
```
For testing purposes, you can compare the optimized structure with the reference:

```bash
$  diff examples/P0DL07_optimised.pdb P0DL07_test/optimised_PDB/P0DL07_optimised.pdb
```

## Running the calculation in the Docker container
```bash
# create folder for the results
mkdir results

# run computation
docker run --rm --name proptimus \
  -v ./examples:/opt/proptimus/examples \
  -v ./results:/opt/proptimus/results \
  local/proptimus \
  raphan.py --PDB_file examples/P0DL07.pdb --data_dir results/P0DL07
```
